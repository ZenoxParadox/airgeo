# airgeo

This code comes with a few disclaimers:
* The elevation is not implemented fully (in Point class)
* The trigonometry formulas are not verified by hand (good practice to do anyway). 
Instead they are implemented and assumed to be correct for the most part.

What this is supposed to show:
* code style
* implementation of criterea (or level thereof)
